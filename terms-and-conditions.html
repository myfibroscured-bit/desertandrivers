        <h4 class="text-primary">1. Who we are</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
          Desert &amp; River provides bespoke, guided desert journeys in the Sinai region of Egypt, based in Dahab.
          “We”, “us”, and “our” refer to Desert &amp; River. “You” refers to the guest making an enquiry or booking.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-primary mt-4">2. Nature of the experience</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
          Our journeys are intentionally small, slow-paced, and designed around land conditions, safety, permissions, and local relationships.
          Routes may change due to weather, access restrictions, safety considerations, or community guidance.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-primary mt-4">3. Enquiries &amp; itinerary design</h4>
        <ul class="text-muted">
          <li>Enquiries can be made by email, WhatsApp, or by booking a call via Calendly.</li>
          <li>Any itinerary outline shared before confirmation is indicative and may change as planning progresses.</li>
          <li>We may decline requests that conflict with safety, ethics, capacity, land protection, or local permissions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="text-primary mt-4">4. Pricing</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
          Prices vary based on duration, group size, logistics, seasonality, and route complexity. Where estimates are shown (e.g., “€300/day”),
          they are indicative and not a fixed offer. Final pricing is confirmed in writing.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-primary mt-4">5. Payments &amp; booking confirmation</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
          A booking is only confirmed once you receive written confirmation from Desert &amp; River and any agreed payment is received.
          Payment methods and any deposit schedule will be agreed during planning.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted small">
          <strong>Template note:</strong> Add your exact deposit %, deadlines, and accepted payment methods here.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-primary mt-4">6. Cancellations &amp; changes</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
          Because journeys are bespoke and require preparation (permits, vehicles, food, guides, and local coordination), cancellation terms may vary.
          Your specific cancellation terms will be confirmed in writing at booking.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted small">
          <strong>Template note:</strong> Replace this section with your real cancellation timeline once you decide it.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-primary mt-4">7. Guest responsibilities</h4>
        <ul class="text-muted">
          <li>Follow guide instructions at all times for safety and environmental protection.</li>
          <li>Inform us of relevant medical conditions, mobility constraints, allergies, and medications.</li>
          <li>Bring appropriate clothing and equipment as advised.</li>
          <li>Respect local culture, privacy, and community boundaries.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4 class="text-primary mt-4">8. Health, safety &amp; risk</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
          Desert travel includes natural risks (heat, terrain, remoteness, rough tracks, limited connectivity). You participate at your own risk.
          We take duty of care seriously and plan responsibly, but risk cannot be eliminated.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-primary mt-4">9. Insurance</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
          We strongly recommend suitable travel insurance that covers guided desert activities and medical evacuation where appropriate.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-primary mt-4">10. Photography</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
          Please ask permission before photographing people or private community spaces. We may request discretion in sensitive areas.
          If you do not want your image used for marketing, tell us in writing.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-primary mt-4">11. Liability limitation</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
          To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Desert &amp; River is not liable for indirect or consequential loss, travel delays outside our control,
          or losses arising from force majeure events. Our total liability for any claim is limited to the amount paid for the journey, except where law prohibits.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-primary mt-4">12. Force majeure</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
          We are not responsible for cancellations or changes caused by events outside our reasonable control (e.g., extreme weather, road closures, security guidance,
          government restrictions, community access changes).
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-primary mt-4">13. Governing law</h4>
        <p class="text-muted">
          These terms are intended to be governed by the laws applicable in Egypt. If you prefer another jurisdiction clause, replace this section.
        </p>

        <h4 class="text-primary mt-4">14. Contact</h4>
        <p class="text-muted mb-0">
